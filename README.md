## More about me 
First of all I am taking Bachelor of Science majoring in **Computer Science** *as shown from my little code intro*, but I am 
also majoring in **Statistics**. This is my seocnd year at this degree and my third year at the University of Auckland, 
I am actually originally from Christhcurch "moving to the *big city*".

Ultimatley I don't actually like stats, I think its a bit boring and something just beneficial i should know, when I first joined STATS 220 I was just expecting it to be just another stats course... But when I flund out this course to be a lot more computational and programming my mood to this course switched up entirely - I have a diagram/table inserted bellow that describes my switch up 

### Diagram to show

> Here I used some HTML to fit images better in the table :)
### Some Extra facts 
* I ride a motorcyle - I use this to commute to and from uni because of the absolutely horrific traffic in Auckland
* You'll find me at the gym **A LOT**
* I also **love** cats

### Goals for STATS220 
1. Ensure I do well in this ensure
2. Ensure Plan 1 goes to success
3. Look at Plan 2

### I bet you can't get to the bottome of this 
The task says I need to ass a weblink so I have added a pretty cool website, my goal is for you to get to the bottom of the page - Have Fun :)
